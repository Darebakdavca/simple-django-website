            I am a software developer with a passion for web development. I have experience in front-end development using Taiwind CSS, Flask, Django, Python, Javascript, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to learn new things.
            I have created this website as my freetime project, because I wanted to broaden my knowledge in the Django framework. I also enjoy programming in Java.
